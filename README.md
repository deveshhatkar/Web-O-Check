# Web-O-Check
This is a small website which was designed as a part of a Web Designing event used in the first round of the event. What is aims is to provide a puzzle (more of like a treasure hunt) to reach a task to be accomplished in round 1 of the event. 

SOLUTION TO THE PUZZLE:

On the first page nothing appears except the black screen. But the thing is the contents are hidden i.e. it's visibility has been set to hidden. So you need to inspect the code and remove the line 'visibility: hidden' so that contents of the first page become visible.
This page will have a button to move forward.

On the second page there is a small game 'Kaun banega score pati' which starts with a click of a button. It asks a few question related to HTML/CSS and javascript and also calculates participant's score. The final score is then displayed at the end of the game.
A Button takes them to the next task

The next task is nothing but to validate a registration form given on the webpage. But the fun part is that they have realize what is missing in the form (which is code for validation). On completion of the validation task they can be graded by the co-ordinator of the event.

HOW TO USE THIS:

Well it is very simple. Just copy the whole Web-O-Check folder to htdocs (incase you are using xampp, and similar process for your web server) and you can browse the pages using Xampp.

PURPOSE OF THIS REPOSITORY:

The main objective behind creating this repository is to provide the co-ordinator with an idea of how he can also conduct round one of a web designing event. This idea is easy to implement and can be given to a big of mass of participants, which is usually a case in the first round of any event.
